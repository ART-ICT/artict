These include macro X-Ray fluorescence (MA-XRF) scanning and hyperspectral imaging (HSI). Combining MA-XRF and HSI data - providing elemental and molecular information - offers huge potential for improved identification, characterization, and visualisation of the materials and features of interest in a painting, including in sub-surface layers of the painting. However, it is increasingly recognised that the wealth of data associated with these modalities cannot be fully exploited through traditional primarily manual approaches to interrogating heritage science data.</p><p>The aim of this research - bringing together ICT and Heritage Science researchers to enable the cross-pollination of ideas and expertise - is to co-create new automatic signal analysis and processing tools that are able to <i>fuse</i> MA-XRF and HSI data to support the technical study, conservation and preservation artwork.</p><p>For more information about the project see the <a href=\"https://gtr.ukri.org/projects?ref=EP%2FR032785%2F1\">UKRI</a> and <a href=\"https://gow.epsrc.ukri.org/NGBOViewGrant.aspx?GrantRef=EP/R032785/1\">EPSRC</a> webpages about the project.</p>",

Although it is difficult to identify with the naked eye, there are areas of refill throughout the painting. (Image from Wikipedia)<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/center> <h2>Challenge</h2> <p> As a painting ages, parts of its pigment layers fall off or lose their original colors, due to chemical interactions with the surrounding environment.To maintain the completeness and vividness of the paintings, art conservators and restorers fill in areas of paint loss or repaint discolored areas. Identifying the pigments used in the creation of the artwork as well as differentiating between retouched and original areas of a painting are crucial in preserving it, reviving it and understanding its history. In recent decades non-invasive material detection techniques (e.g. X-ray fluorescence, abbreviated as XRF) have gained momentum throughout the cultural heritage scientific community. In the context of art conservation, these techniques allow for the detection of elements present in paintings under study; more precisely, algorithms designed for material detection (e.g. see <a href='https://art-ict.github.io/artict/case%20study%20two.html'>Case Study 2</a>) process the XRF “data cube” and provide elemental maps (see Fig. 2 below) indicating the presence of various elements across the painting. However, even with the help of elemental maps, it is still a challenging task to identify pigments (typically compounds or mixtures of compounds that consist of several elements) and thereby distinguish retouched areas, based on the scrutiny of elemental maps one by one.</p> <center> <figure class=\"figure\"><img src=\"graphics/duke_fig2.jpg\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid rounded\" style=\"\" alt=\"example lead and titanium maps\"><figcaption class=\"figure-caption\">Figure 2: The elemental map of lead (left) shows where lead is present (brighter areas) in a section from Andromeda’s body in Perseus and Andromeda. Black dots throughout the map show where lead-containing paints were lost. The elemental map of titanium (right) shows refilled areas. Titanium compounds were not used as  pigments in Titian’s time (the element was discovered only in the 18th century); this anachronism confirms the brighter areas in the titanium map to be retouches, as already suspected by the matches between their shapes and those of paint losses in the lead map.<\/figcaption><\/figure><\/center><h2>Approach</h2><p>In this project, we use a wavelets-based representation to take advantage of the similarity between the maps for different elements in the spatial domain (joint sparsity in the wavelet representation) to provide pigment-mixture maps. These maps can be used by the investigators to both “read” the pigments (each of which is typically already a compound of several elements) used by the artist to create the painting, and identify retouches or fills in an automatic fashion (see Fig. 3 below). </p><\/center><center><figure class=\"figure\"><img src=\"graphics/duke_fig3.jpg\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid rounded\" style=\"\" alt=\"Example processed elemental maps\"><figcaption class=\"figure-caption\">Figure 3: The pigment-mixture map on the left is one of 9 maps that our model generated based on 13 elemental maps (calcium, chromium, cobalt, copper, iron, two lead maps, manganese, mercury, potassium, tin, titanium, zinc). This pigment has a high content of cobalt, often used for blue pigments; this is consistent with the pigment map largely corresponding to the blue background in the painting. The pigment-mixture map on the right, generated with the same model, largely matches with areas where titanium was detected. <\/figcaption><\/figure><\/center><div class=\"alert alert-success\" role=\"alert\">\r\n\t<b>Research Team: </b> <i>Duke University</i> - Ingrid Daubechies, Barak Sober, Hojung (Ashley) Kwon</div>",

		"title": "ARTICT - Algorithms that Helped Reveal Leonardo's Hidden Drawings",
		"content": "<h2>Challenge</h2><p>Macro X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) scanning is an increasingly widely used imaging technique for the non-invasive detection and mapping of chemical elements in Old Master paintings. A macro XRF scanning device sequentially illuminates sub-millimetre spots (or pixels) of a painting with a primary X-ray beam that can penetrate through surface layers, exciting the emission of X-ray photons with energies that are specific to the chemical elements present within the pigments used in the painting. The X-ray photons emitted at each pixel are detected as a spectrum consisting of a collection of pulses due to all of the elements in this region. Hence, the presence of an element can be confirmed in a particular region if all the expected pulses corresponding to that element are detected within the XRF spectrum. However, paintings are created by complex pigment mixtures and therefore many elements are present at each single pixel often also due to the presence of  concealed designs below the surface. As a consequence of that it is quite common that pulses related to elements of interest in a painting overlap. The process to disentangle these pulses is very challenging and is known in the heritage sector as “deconvolution”.<h2>Approach</h2><p>Existing approaches for XRF signal deconvolution require varying degrees of expert user input. Our team  has developed a new fully automatic method to process XRF spectra. It automatically detects the pulses within the signal and produces the element distribution maps for the painting and a confidence map. The methods is able to separate nearby pulses and is also able to retrieve weak signals buried in noise [1]. Our approach leverages ideas in spectral estimation and sparse sampling theory to fully exploit the specific properties of the XRF spectra. The algorithm has helped the discovery of abandoned under-drawings in Leonardo’s “The Virgin of the Rocks” [1] (see also Fig.1).</p><center><figure class=\"figure\"><img src=\"graphics/imp_F1.jpg\" class=\"figure-img img-fluid rounded\" style=\"\" alt=\"Example processed elemental maps\"><figcaption class=\"figure-caption\">Figure 1.

		"content": "<h2>Challenge</h2><p>X-radiographs (X-ray images) are a particularly valuable tool during the examination and restoration of paintings because these can help establish the condition of a painting (e.g., whether there are losses and damages that may not be apparent at the surface, perhaps because of obscuring varnish, overpainted layers, structural issues, or cracks in the paint) and the status of different paint passages (e.g., help to identify retouchings or fills).</p><p>However, interpreting X-ray images can be problematic because – due to the penetration ability of x-rays – these can contain features appearing on the front, back, or even within the painting.</p><p>A classic example relates to the well-known polyptych panel painting The Adoration of the Mystic Lamb (the Ghent Altarpiece), completed before 1432 by the brothers Hubert and Jan van Eyck (see Figs. 1 and 2), where X-ray images of outer wing panels contain features of the paintings appearing both on the front and back of the panel (see Fig. 3).</p><p><i>The challenge relates to the separation of the mixed X-ray images from the double-sided panels into separate X-ray images of corresponding (imagined) “one-sided” paintings. </i></p><h2>Approach</h2><p>Our team has developed a suite of entirely new self-supervised deep learning based approaches to tackle this X-ray image separation problem [1,2].
